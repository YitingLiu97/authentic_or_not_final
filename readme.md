## About
Living from overseas made us see the importance in educating people what authentic food really is. We created the game in a playful way to educate people two cuisines: one Chinese cuisine -- green pepper with pork, and one Indian cuisine -- Chicken Biryani since I am from Hunan province in China and Shannel is from Mumbai, India.
